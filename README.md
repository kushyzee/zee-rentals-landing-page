[mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) gave me the solution on how to align flex items horizontally using `margin-left` auto

[kevin powell](https://youtu.be/sNYVqfRwX1A) His youtube channel contains a lot of css tips and tricks. I learned about the isolation property which i used for the car background as seen in the desktop layout
